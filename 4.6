#4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. Award time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of time-and-a-half in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function. 
hrs = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
hours = float(hrs)
rte = raw_input("Enter rate amount:")
rate = float(rte)

def standardpay(hours, rate):
	added = hours * rate
	return added

def computepay (hours, rate):
	overtime = hours - 40
	tempbufferfourty = 40 * rate  
	tempbufferremainder = overtime * (1.5 * rate)    
	total = tempbufferfourty + tempbufferremainder
	return total

if hours <= 40: 
	total = standardpay(hours, rate)
	print total
else: 
	total = computepay(hours, rate)
	print total
